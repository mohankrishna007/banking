                <h2>Past, present and future</h2>
Since the Lincoln administration signed our national bank charter No. 24 in 1863,
 we’ve drawn on our financial strength to serve customers.
  This has been especially evident in times of need, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
  Our response by the end of 2020 included a $20 million premium pay program for our employees, 
  relief assistance and 108,000 Small Business Administration Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans for our customers,
   and $30 million in expedited charitable contributions for our communities. As a result, 
   we’re proud to have been named the most essential bank amid the pandemic in a ranking by The Harris Poll.
We also recognize that this past year has fundamentally changed banking by accelerating the shift to digital products and services. 
We’re positioned well for this future,having launched new tools – like the U.S. Bank Smart Assistant™ – 
to complement our 26-state branch footprint.
